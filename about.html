        <p>I am a Creator. I am a self-taught Artist, designer & developer. I was born in the Philippines, my father is
          Scottish-Jamaican, my mother is Filipino-Chinese, and I grew up in Hong Kong. I did some travelling and I have
          lived in England for over 12 years. I was a teacher and a childrenâ€™s entertainer in Hong Kong, I am also an
          abstract & hyper realist artist.</p>

        <p>I feel the projects I have in my portfolio show the skills I have gained through courses, reading and
          practicing. It also shows how focused I am to progress further. I am very passionate about web developing and
          design, it simultaneously challenges me, intrigues me and motivates me.Its a little magical, too.</p>

        <p>About 2 years ago, I bought a book called "Get Coding" for my son. He was interested in coding and we decided
          to do the projects together. We followed the instructions and typed into the text editor- not quite able to
          visualize my destination. It felt like a puzzle and I was putting pieces in places and then moving them again.
          I had been an artist working with paints and colors, I was used to seeing the brush strokes and the results of
          those brush strokes immediately. This was a unique experience to me but then we opened the document in our
          browsers, and I was amazed! It felt like magic, I had put in the spells, mixed the cauldron and summoned the
          magic!! It was the start of a whole new perspective of creativity.</p>

        <p>I then signed up to Code Camp and as I worked through the course my interest grew. I signed up to Code
          Academy and I loved the way it went over what I had learned in Code Camp. It seemed to cement my knowledge and
          understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I wanted to create more, and I took some more web developer courses
          on Udemy. I made more pages and simple games. I played around with the commands, I googled other ways of
          creating moving parts and found an array of creations.</p>
